# Firebase Security Configuration and Best Practices

## Security Rules Implementation

### Firestore Security Rules
- ✅ User data isolation (users can only access their own data)
- ✅ Role-based access control (admin, teacher, learner roles)
- ✅ Email verification requirement for account creation
- ✅ Content moderation for community features
- ✅ Rate limiting through Firestore rules

### Storage Security Rules
- ✅ File type validation (images, audio, video only)
- ✅ File size limits (5MB for images, 50MB for user content)
- ✅ User isolation for personal files
- ✅ Teacher/admin permissions for educational content

## Authentication Configuration

### Providers Enabled
- [x] Email/Password
- [x] Google OAuth
- [x] Facebook OAuth
- [ ] Apple Sign-In (optional)
- [ ] Phone Number (optional)

### Security Features
- [x] Email verification required
- [x] Password reset functionality
- [x] Account deletion with data cleanup
- [x] Session management
- [x] Multi-factor authentication (optional)

## Environment Configuration

### Production Environment Variables Required
```bash

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-deployment
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Security rules tested
- [ ] SSL certificates configured
- [ ] Domain verification completed
- [ ] Content policies reviewed

### Post-deployment
- [ ] Monitor Firebase usage and billing
- [ ] Set up alerts for suspicious activity
- [ ] Configure backup schedules
- [ ] Test all authentication flows
- [ ] Verify security rules in production

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Firebase Console Monitoring
- Monitor authentication events
- Track Firestore read/write operations
- Monitor storage usage
- Review security rule violations

### Custom Alerts
- Failed authentication attempts
- High API usage
- Storage quota approaching
- Unusual user activity patterns

## Security Best Practices

### Data Protection
1. **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
2. **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege
3. **Data Validation**: Input validation on client and server
4. **Audit Logging**: Track all data access and modifications

### User Privacy
1. **GDPR Compliance**: User data export and deletion
2. **Privacy Controls**: User-configurable privacy settings
3. **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary data
4. **Consent Management**: Clear consent for data usage

### Application Security
1. **XSS Prevention**: Content Security Policy headers
2. **CSRF Protection**: Token-based request validation
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and DoS attacks
4. **Dependency Security**: Regular security updates

## Backup and Recovery

### Automated Backups
- Daily Firestore exports to Cloud Storage
- User data backup before account deletion
- Configuration backups for disaster recovery

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Data Recovery**: From Cloud Storage exports
2. **Point-in-time Recovery**: Using Firestore backup
3. **Disaster Recovery**: Full system restoration plan

## Compliance

### Legal Requirements
- [x] Privacy Policy implemented
- [x] Terms of Service implemented
- [x] Cookie Policy configured
- [x] GDPR compliance features
- [x] Data retention policies

### Educational Content
